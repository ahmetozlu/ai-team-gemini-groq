## 🚀 Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build a lightweight AI team leveraging **multiple agents**. Whether you’re experimenting with AI models or learning about agent orchestration, this is the perfect starting point.

Key features include:
- **GeminiAgent**: Processes natural language input.
- **GroqAgent**: Performs statistical analysis on numeric data.
- **Phidata Integration**: Orchestrates communication between agents.

This project is designed to be **easy-to-use**, **extendable**, and **educational**.

## ✨ Features

✔️ Process text inputs with **GeminiAgent**  
✔️ Perform statistical analysis with **GroqAgent**  
✔️ Use **Phidata** for multi-agent task management  
✔️ Modular design for easy customization and scaling

## 🛠️ Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-team-gemini-groq.git
   cd ai-team-gemini-groq
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📖 Usage

The program allows you to interact with **Gemini** and **Groq** agents directly from the terminal. Simply follow the on-screen prompts:

### Example 1: Processing Text
```plaintext
Enter text to process: Hello, AI world!
GeminiAgent: I processed the text: 'Hello, AI world!'.
```

### Example 2: Analyzing Data
```plaintext
Enter a list of numbers separated by commas: 10, 20, 30, 40
GroqAgent: Analysis result: {'mean': 25.0, 'max': 40, 'min': 10}.
```

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **GeminiAgent**: Handles text processing tasks, simulating a language model's response.  
2. **GroqAgent**: Handles numerical data and returns simple statistical analyses.  
3. **AgentManager**: Orchestrates tasks between Gemini and Groq based on the input type.

## 🎯 Roadmap

- [ ] Add a GUI for user interaction.  
- [ ] Extend agent functionality for image processing.  
- [ ] Integrate a memory feature for persistent storage.
